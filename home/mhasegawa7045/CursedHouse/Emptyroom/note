Dear participant,
You may be wondering why you are here, or who you are?
But that does not matter since your goal should be knowing how to leave this house. 
This house is not safe for anyone to stay for too long, so you have to find your way to freedom.
It will not be easy...and if you fail you die.

You will need to learn skills as you go through this place, 
and solve puzzles and riddles in order to go through the door that leads to freedom. 
The door is locked with a secret password. Find the password and unlock you way to freedom.

Here's your first hint, since I know you're too inferior to understand this world...

Type this if you want to see you're surroundings
ls 

Then type this to get out of the room and to the hallway or any other room:
cd LOCATION
cd Hallway

You already know this, but as a friendly reminder remember to use the command:
cat *****
cat note
To read NOTES

In short,

cd LOCATION: allows to MOVE to different locations

cat note: allows to READ notes

ls: allows to SEE you're surroundings

REMEMBER THESE COMMANDS

Good Luck,
~ S. :))))
P.S.
The commands are case-sensitive
